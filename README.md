# AO3 Custom UI

A Chrome extension that can modify the appearance of AO3 for those who don't have an account or find the edit site skin process too time-consuming.

## Installation

Follow these steps to add AO3 Custom UI to your Chrome browser:

1. Download the source code from this repository then upzip the files.

2. Go to Extensions on Google Chrome.

3. Toggle "Developer mode" on.

4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the upzipped folder.

And you're done!

## Features

- Change font family, font size, page width, line spacing; add indentation to paragraphs.

- Change background and text colors.

- Remember the settings so that the settings stay the same when user refresh tab, open new AO3 tabs, and even when restart the computer.

## Notes

For now, this extension only changes the area surrounding each work, not the entire page. It may be expanded in the next versions.
